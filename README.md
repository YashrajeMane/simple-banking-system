# Bank Accounting System (Python)

## About the Project
I am currently learning Python, and to apply the concepts I learn in a practical way, I started this project. This is a console-based banking system where I practice Python logic by building real features step by step.
As I learn new Python concepts, I improve the code, update the logic, and add new features to this program.

## Disclaimer
This program has many bugs because of incorrect logic, wrong Python style, spelling mistakes, and typing mistakes. In some conditions the program may fail or give an empty response, and some numbers may be wrong. I am trying to fix these issues and add more features to it.
#### Improve Old, Create New.

## Features (Initial Program)
- Money withdrawal
- Add money to account
- Transfer money to another account
- Change account PIN
- Forgot PIN handling
- Upgrade withdrawal limit
- Change maximum PIN attempts
- Unblock blocked account
- Check account balance
- Check withdrawal limit
- View remaining PIN attempts
- Exit option

## Purpose
This project is made only for learning and practice. Every time I learn something new in Python, I try to apply it here so I can understand how things work in real programs.

## About UPDATE LOG
Every Monday, even if the update is not fully finished.

## Future Plans
- Improve existing logic
- Add more features
- Make the code cleaner and better structured
- Apply advanced Python concepts as I learn them

## Author
Created by a Python learner(me) to practice programming concepts.
