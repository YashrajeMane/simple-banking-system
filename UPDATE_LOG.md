# UPDATE 1.1.0
## Status - In Progress
## OTI Integration and Account System (Monday Update)

New update called OTI (Online Transaction Infrastructure), This update is a major change compared to the first version.

What I added in this update:
- OTI system with account creation and login
- Create bank account section with three options:
  - Create current bank account
  - Create saving bank account
  - Login to bank account
- Support for storing data of up to 9 users using lists
- Shifted from fixed values to stored user data
- Added Python functions, new keywords, and different logic
- Removed some old features that did not fit the new structure

This update is still under development.
Many features are incomplete and some logic needs fixing.
